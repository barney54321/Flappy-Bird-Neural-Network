STEPS:
1. Create initial population with random neural networks
2. Get all units to run simultaneously
3. For each unit calculate its fitness (fitness function)
4. Once all are dead, create next generation  (replacement strategy)
5. Repeat from step 2

Fitness Function:
fitness = (distance travelled) - (distance from centre of gap)

Replacement Strategy:
1. Sort the units by their fitness
2. Select the top 4 units and pass them onto next generation
3. Create 2 offspring as a crossover product of two best winners
4. Create 1 offspring a the average of the two best winners
5. Create 2 offspring as a crossover product of two random winners
6. Create 1 offspring as a direct copy of a random winner
7. Apply random mutation on each offspring to add some variations
